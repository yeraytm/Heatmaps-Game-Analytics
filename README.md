Unity Project of a heatmap generation demo.

Allows to play with the granularity and scale of the map and change the type of data to display.

## Control & Indications

- Scale has a range from 0 to 100. If the value is set between 1 to 100, the normalizing value is set to that value; but if it is set to 0, the normalizing value is the peak value of the set of data.
- The camera rotation is controlled with the mouse and the zoom is done with the scrollwheel. LSHIFT blocks the camera rotation.
- Each of the three buttons on the UI change the type of Heatmap to display in real-time.
