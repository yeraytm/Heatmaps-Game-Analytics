Unity Project of a heatmap generation demo.

Allows to play with the granularity and scale of the map and change the type of data to display.

- Scale has a range from 0 to 100. If the value is set between 1 to 100, the normalizing value is set to that value; but if it is set to 0, the normaliing value is the maximum value of the data itself.
